Shared Dependencies:

1. **React**: All the `.tsx` files will share the dependency on React as they are written in JSX syntax which is a syntax extension to JavaScript and is used with React to describe what the UI should look like.

2. **Next.js**: All the `.tsx` files and `next.config.js` will share the dependency on Next.js. Next.js is the core framework that powers the application.

3. **TypeScript**: All the `.tsx` and `.ts` files share the dependency on TypeScript. TypeScript is used to add static types to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and developer experience.

4. **CSS**: The `globals.css` file and any other component that requires styling will share the dependency on CSS. CSS is used to style the web pages.

5. **Document Component**: The `_document.tsx` file exports a custom `Document` component. This component is used by Next.js to augment the application's HTML structure.

6. **App Component**: The `_app.tsx` file exports a custom `App` component. This component is used by Next.js to initialize pages. Other pages like `index.tsx` will be children of this `App` component.

7. **API Route**: The `hello.ts` file under the `api` directory is an API route. Other parts of the application can use this API route to fetch data.

8. **Header and Footer Components**: The `Header.tsx` and `Footer.tsx` components will likely be used across multiple pages in the application, making them shared dependencies.

9. **Public Assets**: The `favicon.ico` and `vercel.svg` files in the `public` directory are static assets that can be used across the application.

10. **Package.json**: This file will contain the list of all the dependencies and scripts for the application. All the other files indirectly depend on this file as it manages the packages they use.

11. **tsconfig.json**: This file will contain the configuration for TypeScript. All `.ts` and `.tsx` files depend on this file for TypeScript compilation rules.

Please note that without the actual code, it's hard to determine the exact shared dependencies such as exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, and function names.
